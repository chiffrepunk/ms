If you pick your random password out of base64-characters (basically
lower case letters, upper case letters, numbers and 2 symbols), 20
characters give you 120 bits of entropy. Make them into 5 groups of 4
characters and make a short story for each of those 5 groups. That's 2
hours of work for as much password as you will ever need for the rest of
your life. That's what I call a good investment. You can derive any real
password you ever need from this master password.
